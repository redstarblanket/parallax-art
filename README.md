# parallax-art
>Code applied to a digital art piece to give it an interactive parallax effect through click and drag on desktop, and touch an motion controls on mobile.
The method of coding to add interactivity was adapted from Jarom Vogel's Art and Code Parallax lesson.
## The art piece
The drawings used to make up the image layers in the art piece are my own. It is my version of Hamtaro fan art based on the "Diamonds if Sugar" episode.
