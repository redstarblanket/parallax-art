# parallax-art
>Code applied to a digital art piece to give it an interactive parallax effect through click and drag on desktop, and touch an motion controls on mobile.
The method of coding to add interactivity was adapted from Jarom Vogel's Art and Code Parallax lesson.
## The art piece
The art used to make up the images in the art piece is my own. It is my version of Hamtaro fan art based on the "Diamonds if Sugar" episode.
- made using Adobe Illustrator
